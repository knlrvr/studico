## Releases
![v1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-38bdf8) ![date](https://img.shields.io/badge/Aug_18_2024-informational) ![description](https://img.shields.io/badge/Official_Release-grey)     

Users may sign in via Google or create an account. Auth is handled completely by [Clerk](https://clerk.com/). Once signed in, users can create a project where they'll be able to track progress via task creation/completion, upload & manage their files, and communicate with collaborators directly within each project. Progress is monitored via task completion, so it's entirely dependent on user input. Users can invite collaborators to each project, or if a user is collaborating with a group on multiple projects, they can create an organization.
